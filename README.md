# SkillTree-RPG---Gamified-Learning-Platform
Gamified learning platform with skill trees, quests, XP tracking, AI mentor, social challenges, progress dashboard, and a resume builder highlighting gained skills.
To execute the contents of the SKILLTREE.zip file, follow these general steps depending on what kind of project it is (e.g., a web app, Python script, etc.). I’ll guide you through the basic process assuming it’s a development project (like a React app, Python app, etc.). Here's how:

🧩 Step 1: Extract the ZIP File
Right-click the SKILLTREE.zip file.

Select Extract All (Windows) or Unzip (Mac/Linux).

Choose a location and extract the contents.

📁 Step 2: Identify the Project Type
Look for key files inside the extracted folder:

package.json → Node.js project (like React, Express, etc.)

index.html → Simple HTML/JS frontend

main.py / .ipynb → Python project

README.md → Often contains usage instructions

⚙️ Step 3: Run the Project Based on Its Type
🔵 If it’s a Node.js/React project:
Open the folder in VS Code.

In the terminal, run:


npm install
npm start
This installs dependencies and starts the development server.

🟢 If it’s a Python project:
Open the terminal in the extracted directory.

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install required packages (if a requirements.txt exists):


pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script:


python main.py
🟡 If it has an HTML file:
Just double-click index.html or open it in a browser.

If it needs a local server (e.g., fetch requests), use:


npx serve
Or in Python:

python -m http.server
